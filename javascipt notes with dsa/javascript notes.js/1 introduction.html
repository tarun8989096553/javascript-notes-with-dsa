What is Javascript?
JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language(Dynamic programming is defined as a computer programming technique where an algorithmic problem is first broken down into sub-problems, the results are saved, and then the sub-problems are optimized to find the overall solution — which usually has to do with finding the maximum and minimum range of the algorithmic ). It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities.

3 differnt dynamic web pages 
👍 client side , server side , combination

js actually is script based  actuallly scriting lang two type first client side (user) and server side (Back-end)

  it is client side language  js actually is script based language by the help of these we make dynamic wwebiste(intertective) website or webpages

    means over all to say that it convet static webpagege to dynamic webppage  by give some features
    JavaScript is very easy to implement because it is integrated with HTML. It is open and cross-platform.
    There are many useful Javascript frameworks and libraries available:

    Angular
    
    React
    
    jQuery
    
    Vue.js
    
    Ext.js
    
    Ember.js
    
    Meteor
    
    Mithril
    
    Node.js
    
    Polymer
    
    Aurelia
    
    Backbone.js

Hello World using Javascript
Just to give you a little excitement about Javascript programming, I'm going to give you a small conventional Javascript Hello World program, You can try it using Demo link

 Live Demo
<html>
   <body>  
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
         <!--
            document.write("Hello World!")
         //-->
      </script>      
   </body>
</html>

It is really impossible to give a complete list of all the available Javascript frameworks and libraries. The Javascript world is just too large and too much new is happening.

Applications of Javascript Programming
As mentioned before, Javascript is one of the most widely used programming languages (Front-end as well as Back-end). It has it's presence in almost every area of software development. I'm going to list few of them here:

Client side validation - This is really important to verify any user input before submitting it to the server and Javascript plays an important role in validting those inputs at front-end itself.

Manipulating HTML Pages - Javascript helps in manipulating HTML page on the fly. This helps in adding and deleting any HTML tag very easily using javascript and modify your HTML to change its look and feel based on different devices and requirements.

User Notifications - You can use Javascript to raise dynamic pop-ups on the webpages to give different types of notifications to your website visitors.


why java cript work in back =end kuki bhai js scripting language and script ing  lang two type ki hoty client side and server side(backend)







============================================================
JavaScript can be implemented using JavaScript statements that are placed within the
<script>... </script> HTML tags in a web page.

   While it is possible to include JavaScript code inside the <head> tag of an HTML document, it is generally not recommended to do so.

      The reason is that JavaScript code inside the <head> tag will block the rendering of the page until it has finished executing. This means that the user will not see any content on the page until the JavaScript has finished running, which can lead to a slower and less smooth user experience.
      
      Instead, it is generally recommended to include JavaScript code at the end of the <body> tag or to use the defer or async attributes on the <script> tag to allow the page to continue rendering while the JavaScript is loading and executing.
      
      However, there may be certain cases where it is necessary to include JavaScript code in the <head> tag, such as when the JavaScript code is required to set up the page before it is rendered. In such cases, it is important to ensure that the JavaScript code is as lightweight and efficient as possible to minimize the impact on page loading times












So your JavaScript segment will look like −

<script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">
   JavaScript code
</script>
Your First JavaScript Code


This function can be used to write text, HTML, or both. Take a look at the following code.

<html>
   <body>  
      <script language = "javascript" type = "text/javascript">

            document.write("Hello World!")

      </script>      
   </body>
</html>

JavaScript Variables
4 Ways to Declare a JavaScript Variable:
1)Using var
2)Using let
3)Using const
4)Using nothing
What are Variables?
Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).

In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

Example
var x = 5;
var y = 6;
var z = x + y;
In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the let keyword:
js  is used to create client-side dynamic pages.

JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight and cross-platform.

JavaScript is not a compiled language, but it is a translated language. The JavaScript Translator (embedded in the browser) is responsible for translating the JavaScript code for the web browser.


JavaScript is supportable in several operating systems including, Windows, macOS, etc.
It provides good control to the users over the web browsers.
Application of JavaScript :-
1)JavaScript is used to create interactive websites. It is mainly used for:
 1)Client-side validation,
2)Dynamic drop-down menus,
3)Displaying date and time,
4)Displaying pop-up windows and dialog boxes (like an alert dialog box, confirm dialog box and prompt dialog box),
Displaying clocks etc.
